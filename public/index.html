          <h4>My Recommended Mashup: Outkast &amp; Glass Animals</h4>
          <p>Alex grew up right here in Seattle. His musical tastes have evolved over the years. Growing up, his family and friends influenced what he listened to. His big sister was listening to Soundgarden, Weezer, and Nirvana. His dad was a huge fan of Ray Charles, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Seal. Mom was all about the Rolling Stones, the Who, and the Doors. His friends were listening to Eminem, Outkast, and anything by the Cash Money Millionaires. Nowadays, all the cool kids are into electronic stuff, and he's into it as long as the beats aren't too crazy. Alex was a cook prior to attending Code Fellows, and is happy and excited for this new challenge!</p>

          <a href="https://github.com/agrampa"><h3 class="green">Allie Grampa</h3></a>
          <h4>My Recommended Mashup: Billy Joel &amp; Lady Gaga</h4>
          <p>Allie is originally from Cleveland, Ohio. By default, she is a Browns fan, which is a tough life to lead but she does it with passion. She started learning the basics of coding while working for a wedding website called Joy. Since moving to Seattle, she has spent a lot of time hiking and snowboarding. She is always on the hunt for the perfect sushi, perfect pizza, and perfect chocolate chip cookie.</p>

          <h4>My Recommended Mashup: Big Bang &amp; John Legend</h4>
          <p>Major K-POP lover, especially Big Bang, Christina likes to explore Seattle and find good places to eat. She also thinks that dogs are better than cats by far because cats are weird and kind of selfish. She is very particular but she usually has a logical reason why. She was previously working in real estate before joining Code Fellows and is excited to not deal with unrealistic people anymore. "Come say hi to me because I like meeting new interesting people!"</p>

          <h4>My Recommended Mashup: Nirvana &amp; Pearl Jam</h4>
          <p>I am orginally from Olympia.  I recently graduated with my bachelor's degree and found myself spending more time coding than working on my homework.  When I heard about Code Fellows I jumped on the opportunity to take my web development skills to the next level.  When I am not coding I enjoy writing, recording, and mixing music.  If I am not in the studio, then you will probably find me in the kitchen cooking pizzas for my wife and two daughters.</p>
